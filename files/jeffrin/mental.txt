deep fear in my heart that i will use vulgar related words in my thoughts.
deep fear in my heart that i will do sex in my mind
to marry is not a solution to above problems
instead find out the reason behind those problems
i fear that i will lose the love of god if i  think vulgar words or sex.
not marrying  a girl with beauty in your dreams is not a failure or
it will not create sexual dissatisfacrion.Be open to marriage.
god will love you with his mercy. leaving your mother for marriage
is not wrong because god will love my mother  and take care of her..
i have the urge to do sex, but it cannot be done outside marriage.
there is no problem in marrying a girl even when my mother is alive.
the above line is hereby nullified.
