Path : (Tuning) ( Computing with Mathematical Background )  and other plan or plans
------
Algorithm of things which are :
1. Simple. (First Level related)
2. Fundamental.
3. Library
4. Function
5. GNU Tool Chain
6. Operating Systems.
7. Computer Networks.

may be core area is : Interfacing relating to  all of the seven above


try to write a classical book on tuning.
try to write a book about the art of fixing things in computing.



An algorithm becomes a function when used in an application.

try to read about database concepts and typical related things
try to contribute to libmysql library

no need to contribute to mysql library for now.( san advice related )


try to know everything about  Algorithms/Function ( GNU C library algorithms . example : sqrt() function)   
and fundamentals of other necessary fields.
 

keep one book on geometry (david .... i got it ))
keep one book on applied physics ( i got it)
keep one book on chemistry (General book)
keep one book on mathematics ( General Book )


focus on GNU C library Algorithms/Functions .
tuning of/with  algorithms for an optimal configuration 
try to use Gcov.
(try to use a command named "script" for the above
focus on scripts for kernel related. ex: linux-3.10.0/scripts ( scripting with Bash )



My contributions to the world will be as :

a scientific  sharing knowledge through beautifulwork.
---------------------------------------------------

try to maintain a print version of beautifulwork
try to document to beautifulwork about Algorithm :
1. analysis of GNU C library.
2. Testing of GNU C library.
3. Improvement to GNU C Library.


a typical beautifulwork page.
from top down :

1. learning model ( any one of the learning models i have documented )
2. comment(analysis) from algorithms(science)  about function/API discussed.
3. Gcov test report
4. comment about the improvement of the algorithm.



a hacker through savannah beautifulwork.
---------------------------------------

try to write code for geometric functions.
try to form a library using those functions.
try to write an application using that library.



if there is a lot of code reading  to be done, i will do it only if i feel that people may use it.
i like to port some GNU software that work in commandline interface to a web interface(as a web application). 


programming blog:

1. you feel  tired of programming because you are
trying to program in a framework. you usually have
problem working in a particular time frameworks.
i usually like to play with things than work.

2. try to solve same problem in different programming
languages.

3. try to solve every function in different programming languages.


4. you may get new ideas maybe when you excercise or play with a function.
play means like coding a user defined functions in different languages.

5. try to rewrite the same program again and again so may be
your brain may get comfortable  with the patterns.

6.be slow and easy.


notes :

1. read code and write useful scripts for functions.
you can take a function in trueprint program and write
a relevent script for that function. a script that supports
the function in code in a way .Also create a directory called
"scripts" inside parent directory.

2 . you find it easy to work on already created things.
like hacking on already existing programs.

3. my creativity lies in music a lot.

4. my typical scientific thing lies in problem solving(fixing)
skills and maintanence development(writing scripts and system
administration).


5. i like to be a visual artist.
i like to focus on drawing cartoons for beautifulwork.org posts
using GIMP.

I like to be a "DEBUG METHOD DEVELOPER"

get source code of quicksort in different languages.(C,JavaScript,Perl,Python,C++,Java...)
try to debug all the code with debuggers.gdb , may be firebug .. chrome...related...
may be try to integrate or otherwise if possible run the code into different
environments and conditions and debug to see if there is any bug.fix the bug
or give the idea to fix it to the developer if possible.

also try to learn about linux kernel debugging.

take source code from lots of free software(may be debian) and do
extensive debugging.lot of debugging is studied through testing
(i mean atleast testing the debugger features using a program)
note : Testing programs using debugger and debug techniques
make it a test driven development. a development of debug methods.
(DEBUG METHODS DEVELOPER)

collect pdfs and documents about debugging in other format and 
try to compile whatever necessary and make a series of books like stuff.
prepare a document with the documents you have used for debugging stuff.

try to document and develop methods for unlocking knowledge.
engineering methods and algorithms for unlocking knowledge.
METHODS Developer.
METHODS Algorithm Developer.
Algorithms For Methods Usage.
Package Developer.

Fix/Debug Method Developer.
types of fixes.
a)Code Styling Fixes
b)Style Fixes. (CSS)
c)Build/Compile Fixes.
d)

in www.beautifulwork.org may be it should categorize whatever
that has been done in it to it's proper scientific subject.
for example command "ls" to operating systems ...

[ forming and realizing the team ]
may be write down the softwares and people that are related
to www.beautifulwork.org  and may be watch them, talk to 
them note down their websites and mailing lists and may be also
try to hack the code of the software that beautifulwork.org depends.
search even simple things in google so that you can get the result fast


create posts in beautifulwork.org to explain terminologes like
wrapper,hook,.....

try to include a commandline session of the command that is related
to the proc parameter and the commandline session of the command that
is related to a typical API.

---may be change "UNIX" in the learning models to "GNU/Linux or UNIX"--
a command may be a function of GNU libc or normal bash commands.
try to work with the book "THE LINUX PROGRAMMING INTERFACE"


--new learning model . LM X---
1. commandline session.
2. Video Tutorial ( also give the link of  youtube channel from which the video has been taken , if it is so)

[ it may be good to know the area of my limits and the area where iam unlimited ]

----different angles of beautifulwork----
( document and  organize the entire hack(playful cleverness) session for knowledge building )
1. education with GNU ( play and learn ) - freedom to use the program for any purpose.
2. free software research to know "how things work"  - freedom to study the source code 
to know how things work.

--team-culture-related---
anybody can do any work.
a person can work in multiple roles among different projects at the same time.
maintainers approval is required for the official release of a patch.

---a-patch---
1. content development patch.
2. software development patch.

---Role---
may be initially a person has to take the role of a subscriber.
a person becomes a contributor after his contribution is accepted mainstream.

---different-sub-projects-under-beautifulwork-project--- 
1. learning model 1-10 ( considered as 10 different projects )
2. document of debug sessions ( for debug method development )
3. search development
4. development of data visualization and statistics.

every learning model can have a team of contributors.

--core-work---
the core work of beautifulwork is debug method development.
the final outcome of the beautifulwork project is a book on DM
DMD = Debug Methods.

----do-not-do----
do not try to develop any learning algorithms.

learn about "functions" in mathematics (video tutorial may be easy) and try to make meaningful relations
between mathematic function and GNU commands.also try to make GNU command
or function or algorithms  with the help of laws or theorems in the area
of "functions" in mathematics by "mapping"  between the meaningful relations.


---reason for writing another version of a program can be for the beauty of detailing---
 
---try to stay with wordpress in BeautifulWork Project: Be collaborative---

---try to stay in partnership with other projects---

---in debug method development try to connect topic of "functions" in mathematics to GNU/Linux commands---

---another learning model is to display a single image that explains something ---

---document design principle related . for example " what kind of font should be used where and why ? " ---
try to make things uniform throughout the site and give detailed documentation of what of what is used
in the site.

--- learning model 10 ---
1. EXPLANATORY IMAGE
2. SOURCE RELATED ( SOURCE OF IMAGE )
3. RELATED FROM RESEARCH PAPER (LINK)

--- in connecting ("stitched to") option there is a parent-child  tree like structure  based on necessity ---
suppose topic A have a content which is necessary for topic B . A becomes a parent of B

--- common sections to all learning models is (1. source related 2. related from research paper 3. stitched to
---

---may be modify the wordpress database design and may it suitable for your programming ---

---Test Your programs in a way before moving to live repository---

( first try to set a boundary(may be changing) for the work of beautifulwork and try to
make the work happen within the give limits ) 

--- try to contribute to beautifulwork by solving problems in maths for class (4-12) ---

--- if you stick to the old language even if a new language for the same purpose with new feature has come,
then you may be able to hack the old language and understand programming languages in depth since you
are moving deeper in a language.but a small module with the new language can be done so that both  work
together. but let the old language be the main language ---

--- try to learn php related library API ---
--- you typically become rich in a language when you are rich in it's API related knowledge ---

--- fix PHP and your main language and learn and work with it for 10 years ---
(1. if you keep switching languages you may not able to learn really about programming practices 2. you may
not have a typical(clear well defined failure) to learn from. 3.You can learn certain things only from failures  )

--- if possible always plan a failure in your success plan ---

--- try to write the balancing algorithm ( the balancing act ) for learning in beautifulwork ---

--- if you want to go more core in a way... may be  go core in wordpress internals ---

--- may be giving supportive link for a post is useful . it may form a collection ---

--- may be try to write the balancing act related algorithm  and may be try to connect it with every plugin ---
--- may be a whole lot of code should emerge from the balancing algorithm --- 


--- you may be  a style user,developer and administrator ---

--- change the learning style contents from UNIX command to GNU Command ---

--- make the headings in a all learning styles to normal size(not h1 h2 ..) ---

--- stay with beautifulwork project for atleast 10 years ---

--- it not about doing coding work in the project . make the project with meaningful content 
and may be show things and commands which has a relation to operating system and computer networks ---

--- may be make programs and design weaker than the existing one ---

--- may be make the algorithms tuned for a particular problem ---

--- may it is possible to write 1000 sorting algorithms tuned for 1000 different problems ---

--- normal travel is in the breadth and sometimes you go depth 
    but if you stay in depth for a long time your pressure may 
    increase, so come back to breadth travel again(do come back well before you explode). ---

-- Learn Linux Kernel Debugging ---

--- if you find a library that is doing an advanced job in an area than 
the one your are creating then try to use that library(use the API if possible) in the development of your library ---

--- You should put one single imperfection in every thing you like to perfect ---


--- You keep writing algorithms, and your mind will guide you to find out 
which algorithm is faster and how to fix algorithms to improve speed.
use "time" command normally. ---


--- Always try to master  fundamentals ---

--- Once you master the fundamentals of one topic you can switch on to
   another topic ---

---  may be connecting fundamentals of multiple topics can lead to research ---

--- Topics You can work on( may be you can use these topics as categories for  beautifulwork.org posts ) ---

    for the same problem may not be as you expect it while reading
    their code ---


--- I work for free software(and education), people can use me as a resource 
    for their work ---



--- when you learn algorithms may be you can try to learn where those algorithms
    are used in real life  ---

--- basic research may be defined as that undertaken primarily to acquire
    new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena without regard
    for a particular application. ---

--- benefits of basic research 
1. new knowledge - it is the primary product of basic research.
2. social benefits - the social benefits of educating high quality scientists, technologists
                     and engineers.
3. basic discovery may lead to applications ---

--- we may not know what we are going to discover ---

--- try to find the design specification of a Graphics Card by using
    reverse engineering, which is a High Priority Free Software
    project. Your output will be related to the design spec of
    the Graphics Card ---

--- It may not be necessary to have a complete understanding of a thing
    to make it work. --- 

--- "reverse engineering of algorithms"  may be a topic you can look into ---

--- when you work on  something and if you find it small and not worth working,
    keep working and try to search and find out the importance of that thing ---

--- may be try to bring the output of your work to be easily accessible and understood  ---

--- if you rework and research on basic things, you may be doing a research 
    on a topic you may not know and also an outcome you are not sure about, 
    but the outcome may be connecting all the sections you work on  ---

--- when you work on real life problems section of bw project and if you
    feel that you have not completed a program and you feel that you are 
    drawn towards that program and do not know when to stop typically, 
    then you should try to complete the design of the program using coding 
    and documentation which will be like writing the initial version of the software. ---

--- may be add math and physics as sub groups for your basic research.
    always concentrate on basic and simple stuff ---

--- however simple an algorithm looks, it may better to say "i know it"
    only if you really implement it in code and make it work. ---

--- may be add a link called "papers" to beautifulwork.org for adding papers you make using 
    libreoffice-writer ---

    	      3. learning more python 4. learn fundamentals 5. gaining more programming experience
	      6. capstone project. ---


--- Commandments

    0. Learn and Hack free software (Work With BW and Trueangle Projects)

    1. Take one feature from different projects and try to add it to BeautifulWork Project
       (Do not entirely follow a Project)

    2. Find common thing in all your work and try to connect them.
       ( Knowledge and Learning are common things in BeautifulWork Project )

    3.  Try to build new knowledge by connecting existing knowledge base.

    4. Try to write algorithm to connect existing knowledge packets

    5. Try to write algorithm to create new meaningful knowledge

           #0 define a knowledge packet
	   #1 define a target knowledge packet
	   #3 search for similar packets in the database ( local or in network )
	   #4 order them to make a meaningful new packet or a packet sequence.
           #5 visualize the new packet, so that people may get new ideas

---

Note : --- While working on projects like building gcc , chromium and other stuuf and
       	   other projects , try to see to take a value from that and add to beautifulwork ---

--- may be consider each post of beautifulwork project as data and try to make
    algorithm work for all the posts. --- 

--- may be collect different types of data from all over the world and also
    may be in different formats.

    1. sysstat package has sadf command to make json file out of data file
       created by sar command. ---

--- even if there is nothing new in developing a software the logic may
    always have something new. It may be like that you are building
    several houses and should not get bored after building the first
    house because you can build a house using different way of logic. ---


--- May be one feature of beautifulwork is that people can document their
    command line sessions(like free software code) and share with others
    so that everyone can learn together.there should be analysis about
    the type of commands a person is using and about it's frequency
    and other things if possible. ---

--- may be a feature of beautifulwork is that it works like project hosting
    sites like github.com and savannah.gnu.org.
    the key idea related is to share a improve the learning process.
    commandline screenshot = a knowledge packet
    * project hosted will be a commandline screenshot.
    * commandline screenshot may have revisions.
    * commandline screenshot may be stitched in a sequence to have a special meaning
    * try to make data visualization of the packets.

    ---
    
--- may be you can use python for data analysis and other commandline application 
    if needed in BW Project ---
--- may be you can use html and css for user interface and experiance ---
--- PHP for features of web application  ---
--- Javascript for data visualization ---

--- may be put some things in the download part of BW project
    * make a release for the /lib section and put a tarball.
    * make a release for the /data section - may be as utilities for BW project.
    * make a debian package for /code section - kind of code examples debian package ---


--- may be try to make a debian package of every directory in your github repository ---

--- may be try to make software for  visualization of the programs in "code" section of beautifulwork repository. ---
--- may be try to make software tool for  data analysis from "data" section  for  www.beautifulwork.org ---
--- may be try to make software library out of the "lib" section of beautifulwork repository ---

--- maybe you can use www.asciinema.org to make terminal videos and embed in www.beautifulwork.org ---

--- may be take topics from debian user mailing lists and apply the core commands like ( cat, ls , ps ...)
    to that topic and make a meaningful post ---

--- may be try to write an algorithm that helps balancing a learning process.
    (in the algorithm below implement one thing in every main step and try to make it work)

    0: find out the things that has to be learned.

    1: mark the topics that has to be learned.
       0: create a table in wordpress database and mark the things to be learned
       1: create a target of things to be learned for
       	  understanding Debian GNU and Linux
	  writing an application to analyze data
	  writing multiple sorting algorithms
	  writing a library about bit twiddling hacks.

       2: the database will have multiple tables
       	  one for getting feedback from the learner
	  one for storing the processed(manipulated data) feedback for future use.
       	  

    2: create a  structure from topics to their inner details
       0: may be use php and mysql to access the database.
       1: may be use php to store the data from the database to a new
       	  custom data structure for manipulations. (http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.spl.php)

    3: create relations between the topics.
       

    4: create properties for the relations.

    5: create conditions among properties.

    6: create a logical sequence for a step by step learning process using the conditions. ---

--- may be try to freeze addition of plugins and typical other things and try to make a release ---

--- may be learn and program related to  data structures and sorting algorithms  using multiple languages
   (may be Assembly, C, C++, Java, Clojure, Scheme, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Javascript, PHP, Python, R)  --- 

--- may be in one way do not think that a language will get outdated and there is no use learning it.
    may be even if a new language comes you will be able to read code and fix bugs of the old language
    which may have a large codebase of working applications. ---
 
--- may be you can try to connect lisp and php using sockets ---
--- may be lisp can do some artificial intelligence stuff for B project ---

--- Tools  and purpose in B Project 
    HTML and CSS for Webpages and Web Styling
    JavaScript for Interactivity in Web pages ( for filling forms )
    PHP for scripting ( general wordpress hacking and writing wordpress plugins(learning management)) ---

--- The core language to focus is C.
    It not compulsory to learn lisp or a dozen of languages to be a true hacker.
    A person can become a true hacker by just learning C.
    Focus on C and try to go in depth with C. ---

--- The center of B Project is (Debian,Learning).
    The workflow of the project has multiple starting points and multiple ending points.
    The flow have to meet the center(which is the system(Debian+Learning)) and then produces output 
    Here every input will have an output
    Every Input should have a connection with Debian
    Every Input should have a connection with Learning ---

    Write code using Types, Operators and Expressions.
    Write code using Control flow.
    Write code using Functions.
    Write code using data structures.
    Write code using Input and Output and so on ...
    May be try to use many of the features a programming language has to offer.
    Suppose you are planning to write a software of 1000 lines...
    Consider writing 100 lines of code for 10 features of the language.
    Consider finding ideas and information related to a feature of the language
    and the project you are working upon to increase new lines of code. ---

--- try to solve problems in typical cookbooks . learn by reading the code in that ---
--- may be try to categorize problems . so you may get an idea of the kind of problems you can solve ---
--- may be try to write debug code (the code added to a computer program so that it can be debugged easily )---
--- may be writing debug code is part of [debug method development] ---
--- may be learning htdp and scheme is to learn computer science through a level of abstraction
    may be knowledge of scheme can be used for prototyping. Practical implementation can be done
    with PHP or Python in a simple way. ---


--- may be breadth is more important for you than a typical depth.
    may be document and connect things that you learned while going
    in breadth ---

--- may be write a book about "how to build knowledge in computing using free software".

--- Urban ladder related calculation for church.
31998 * 15
479970
479970/100
4799.7
4799.7/12
399.97499999999997

so product price is 31998 and monthly installment that should be given to church is 400 rupees for 12 months ---

--- may be you can write a book like "data source handbook" with your book named "knowledge source handbook"
    which helps to build related knowledge to GNU/Linux commands and typical related stuff. may be you can
    name a command and then show a related HOWTO from tldp.org .may be you can build a list of commands and the
    links for it's related knowledge ---

--- may be you can use the contents of "knowledge source handbook" and write a book on the
    fundamentals of computing. ---

--- may be your work is in the internet world. you may not talk directly with the students
    or teach them in real class or person , but you can help them through internet.
    your real work may happen in the internet ---

--- may be again you should start contributing to mailing lists like debian-user and others ---

--- may be in doing simple things and finding the design of the thing behind.. you may
    learn related to the first section of each chapter from books you learn
    The above idea may be termed as "Learning Model 1" ---

--- TRY TO DO THE BOOK WORK AND TYPICAL OTHER WORKS(IF EXISTS)
    ALONG WITH THE ADDITION OF POSTS TO THE WEB ---


--- may be i should try to do typical data science course at coursera.
    knowledge in data science may help you debug new things ---

--- data science and knowledge discovery is connected.
    you may need the knowledge of data science for B WORK Project.
    https://www.kaggle.com/ may help in data science ---

--- work flow design for a free software project for a typical hacker =
    1. divide the project into different modules.
    2. stop working on a module after a period of time (may be 2 weeks)
    3. now switch to a new module and do as in step 2
    4. after working with all the modules, then consider a overall rewrite. ---


--- while doing "data" related project using python you should
    at times switch to B WORK Project so as to get confidence and a
    feeling of completeness.B project has crossed 5 years.
    B WORK Project is like your "suvishesha vela" ---

--- In the  dollect project ... may be you should consider data as .pdf files
    and maybe analyzing the content of .pdf (opening pdf as text) files for
    some unique things in pdf files a do visualization related ---
--- in the dollect project, people may use it if the command line is thrilling ---

--- may be in dollect project scaling of lines of code may be done with focusing on fundamentals
    like fundamentals of oop,functional programming, ...data may be embedded in the code. ---

--- may be try to make github repositories base on HOWTOS from http://tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/categories.html
    may be add configuration files to repositories ---

--- may be write and integrate a twitter app, google app, facebook app, github app into B WORK Project
    using the necessary API's ---

--- may be you can do debug method development using data visualization of linux kernel
    may be you can use C(bittwiddling)  and Python and D3 for this
    may be you have to create an algorithm to convert the kernel data dump to a format
    that D3 can accept for visualization ---

--- may be you can concentrate on "processes" from "understading the linux kernel 3e"
    for kernel data dump to produce visualization. ---

--- may be B project should write a wordpress plugin (algorithm related) by which the users can connect
    their posts and find something beautiful. ---

--- may be if you come to know about a new technology through a talk and if you feel
    belittled that you do not know it, then you may try to learn that and put only that
    knowledge that fits(may be a small simple basic part of that)  into your framework.
    but you may not try to go through some on else's typical full  path, because someone
    has already done that. may you should think about you past and try to continue
    the good things that you have done in the past.  may be you should  use data
    structures and visualizing  the data to debug things. may be you have learnt different
    things in past and is a generalist(typical allrounder). may be you also was
    interested in visual things.---

--- may be you can do multiple roles(may be focus on basics).
   (User Interface  Developer)
   (Algorithm Developer)
   (DATA Developer)
   (Debug Method Developer)
   (OS Developer) ---
   

--- may be you should define the allowed number of characters in a line
    of a wordpress post of b project. may be you put sample files in the
    b project site so that the commands in the posts can have sample files
    to operate. ---

--- maybe do learning by doing and you get  design of project by that
    and document the design of the project and may be also the future
    idea for the project . so a typical project starts with hacking(practicals)
    and your job completes in theory paper.
    But may be you should not do research paper beacuse it is better for
    you not to go in depth. for you breadth is important and also connecting
    things together things in the breadth ---

--- may be your beautifulwork wordpress post title be of an abstract kind.
    may be not the name of a typical command but the purpose of the command ---

--- different projects may use different methodologies . may be it is
    not correct to apply same methodologies to all projects. even
    in a single project each stage may require different methodologies ---
    
--- may be when you connect things in breadth you may get idea(wisdom).
    may be you can document those ideas in  B Project along with other
    things like "developer's guide"(if you create). ---


--- try to do documentation for b project using readthedocs.org
    try to make 1. user's guide 2. administrators guide 3. Developers guide.
    user's guide : how to make use of the content to improve your knowledge
    	   	   how to extend and improve the contents of a post.

    administrator's guide: how to install a typical version locally.
			     how to alter the configuration files to change functionality.
                             how to configure database to make a downloadable version.
			   how to make configuration files for apache

    developer's guide: how to develop and free learning environment.
                       


--- may be develop the free learning environment mainly not as a plugin, but may
    be using wordpress api's. may be extensions can be written as  wordpress plugins  ---

--- may be you have a call for "learning". may be help others to learn things. ---

--- may be learn to (start) :
    	1. Hack free software.
	2. Draw pictures of art.
	3. Create designs using GIMP
	4. Build things using Autotools.
	5. Program using python
	6. do administration using GNU/Linux
	7. style using CSS
	8. Web Design using HTML
	9. Document and share using Wordpress ---

--- may be the documentation part of b project should explain how to use "shell sessions"(b project posts related)
    to learn new things and concepts in computing or other general learning. ---

--- may be a simple shell session can give ideas to a big thing or related big concepts or
    ideas to check source code to know internals or find ideas to debug large programs ---

--- may be BASH shell may be used to find the command equivalent for Linux programming API ---

--- may be bash shell commands can be see as an abstraction for linux programming API ---

--- may be it is possible to learn linux internals from bash shell commands ---

--- may be it is possible to understand linux design using the design of bash shell commands ---

--- may be slogan like for b project is "LEARN UNDERSTAND SHARE EVOLVE" ---

--- may be one of the b project output should help people learn bash ---

--- may be wordpress plugins should be written to help learn bash commands  in a simple and beautiful way ---

--- may be in b project try to learn and write posts with a mind set of "what is the need for that command ?" ---

--- may be learning support software should be written in a generic way outside wordpress and then
    later port it as a wordpress plugin or plugins ---

--- may be one of your work in beautifulwork project is to test programming languages(for example JavaScript) ---

--- now suppose you have taken a code from a github project to your wordpress theme for wordpress and bootstrap
    integration for pagination , then you may contribute some code back to that github project with your enhancement
    on that piece of code ---

--- may be focus on beautifulwork using http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/index.html ---

--- may be if you start learning a page and feel like kind of tired, then start reading from the end of the page ---
			
--- may you can jump from wordpress theme development to someting else and not necessary to do some application programming
    and then to system programming. ---

--- may be you can stick with wordpress theme development for a period of time by porting basic(html + css) free themes to
    wordpress themes. ---

--- may be you should do
                       1. things which are easy                  
		       2. things which many can do                        
		       3. things which may not bring you a lot of money       
		       4. things which may become outdated soon
		       ---

--- may be you should have a section in your resume called "command mastery"
    there are things like mastering a language,mastering an a field in systems
    administration etc. ---

--- Wed May 10 18:45:48 IST 2017
    (teach people how to use software(for example : GNU commands))
    beautifulwork.org(beginner + necessary)) : learning process
                                  debug method developer
			
    /truework(intermediate + possible) : use (using debian GNU and Linux kernel) research. (may be write user guides in text files)
                                  teach how to use commands to improve user experience.
		                  teach how to use programming languages.
		                  teach how to use(on commandline) a compiler.

    /openendwork(advanced + impossible) : write my type research paper about single commands ---


--- after learning process if you find a new way to use a command then that may be
    considered as an openend discovery ---

--- "use research" means use research means finding different ways to use a command
     and related things. ---

--- "programming also  can be done in "use research" provided you start it or do it on 
     your own project. --- 


--- may be do gimp work by doing image about a free software command by taking commands
    from B WORK blog. ---

--- may be repeat the same kind of work and you can add creativity to it and learn related
    things and improve knowledge and experience. ---

--- may be you should do 1 single task  a 1000 times ---

--- ethics.
	Your work is majorly system administration
	You also need programming skills needed for system administration.
        You may not be able to learn about computer science the way programmers do.
	You may be able to learn computer science by reading books like "computer science distilled".
        When you apply software engineering principles to system administration,then you become an engineer.    
    	Do not try to learn everything in system administration. 
	You may do system administration projects in github by putting configuration file or others.
        You may do desktop administration as a basic stuff.
        Desktop administration may help you to work or understand about servers.
	Using debuggers helps you find the internals of a program.
	Output of your work maybe - 1.(knowledge sharing and knowledge discovery)
	       	       	    	    2.(fixing bugs in the system and also developing(theory) methods to debug ) --- 
				    

--- may be you should learn about one concept from one book/person/video and then another
    concept from another book/person/video  and connect them together using a software
    project(may be try to complete using the concepts(in programming or systems administration).  ---

--- may be a beginners basic implemention of a concept in code using a little project 
    is the knowledge about  that concept you should acquire. ---

--- may be you should know only the beginner basics about a concept to do debugging. ---

--- may be you should look in a code about 1. the place where user input is accepted.
    	       	      	      	     	   2. what are the functions invovled.(look for function blocks)
					   3. if any function is called from a library.
					   4. may be write "code notes" to understand the logic flow.
					      write down selected code snippets into another file so that
					      you can see the important blocks and connect them to find a
					      logic.(you have written code notes for memtester)

                                           5. search google for help if necessary. ---


--- may be you should write comments in code and help write a patch for debug support . ---
--- may be you should do code reading of python code ---
--- may be you should create separate patches related to each day's  work of code reading
    and learning how the code works and writing comments about that code and also hacking
    the code for testing and understanding internals ---
--- may be you should mark points in the code as a link to related knowledge packet(patch in this context) ---
					   
--- may be new graphic designs comes with new context ---
--- may be you need a mentor  for graphic design ---

--- may be there is something called software trekking , which is like travelling
    the path  of knowledge. one step may lead to another step. may be  you can draw
    the path you travel. may be you can write a wordpress plugin for  software
    trekking. may be you can draw a graph to visualize your knowledge travel.
    may for a basic stuff you may plot a graph taking category of post and time of
    post from wordpress database ---


---  try to work with the API of all team members like google and youtube related)
 the team members listed below may be listed as different projects  related ---

--- may be try to learn javascript by learning a javascript library (paper.js) ---

--- may be python knowledge can help in understanding about programming, oop concepts, data, data structures. ---

--- may be GNU C knowledge can help in understanding about operating systems and computer networks ---

--- may be PHP  knowledge can help in understanding about database and  Web ---

--- may be when you read a document you may skip  parts you do not understand and move forward if
    possible and then may come back to document after doing hacking and have understood contexts or
    may come back when  doubts arise while doing hacking ---

--- may be first do, learning by doing(paper.js) and then try to learn other things of javascript
    from a book ---

--- may when you plan to do things start by doing one small meaningful thing in that area ---  
 
---- may be it can be "learning method developer"--->"knowledge building"--->"debug method developer"
    may be to become a learning method developer you should try to learn things .
    may be for knowledge building you should document and share what you have learned.
    may be to become a debug method developer you should try debugging things.
    there is debugging in learning and learning in debugging. may be learning comes first. ---
    

--- may be you should work on your already published posts(knowledge packets) and improve in
    a typical way. may be start from the first post you have published ---


--- may be two things you want in your typical work is beauty and you want to become a master ---

--- may be write different parts of dollect in different languages like rust. go, python etc ---


--- may be write dollect typically and completely in python ---

--- may be learn two programming languages : (one to support the existing work and other to learn new things and to do new things )
           php -- in a way old but you continue to give service to users through wordpress.
           python -- in a way new and updated. concepts related from other languages are supported.                       "do not try to port the existing work into new language you are learning.
	   maintaining old stuf may be easy and may be stable .
	   it may give you strength to learn new things." so the philosophy
           may be "two things at a time" as far as learning programming languages are concerned. ---
    
--- may be try to write a program using  each and every typical feature in python ---

--- may be you should put automated download feature in dollect project.
    may be you should give command line as well as web user interface for dollect ---


--- may be a few things done by dollect itself can make it a successful program.
    so do not drop a project because it has only a few options ---

--- may be you should concentrate on bug filing in debian . you can do testing
    and applying patches. may be you should do different kinds of testing and
    do not do programming unless for system administration purposes. ---


--- connection :
               may be connect bugs in debian to beautifulwork knowledge building(bkb).
	       may be connect titles in stackoverflow.com to bkb (make posts title same as stackoverflow
	       question related)
	       may be connect manual page title related to command screenshot related --- 

--- may be you know methods to learn and build knowledge ---

--- may be beautifulwork shell sessions can be used to write what actucally a command does.
    it may be used to find out the way  a command in intepreted from the output of the command.
    this use may be used to conduct tests and competition. ---

--- may be a step in debug method development is to find methods to find
    bugs in a program. this can be accomplished by first testing program that needs to be
    debugged.may be learn different types of testing methods in free software.
    may be some methods to find bugs are 1. reading log files 2. running programs in terminal
    3. building programs from source  --- 
   

---  A  MODEL OF LEARNING IN WHICH YOU DO NOT TYPICALLY NEED TO TYPICALLY LEARN
     ALL OF THE WORK IN THAT AREA
     	  0. HERE YOU LEARN THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE AND HISTORY IN THAT AREA 
          1. HERE YOU BUILD KNOWLEDGE BY CONNECTING THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED --- 
	  
	     

--- about bopen plugin in beautifulwork project . try to connect posts and may be other things
    and find their abstractions . for example Mac OX and GNU/Linux are related to unix and a typical
    abstraction is operating system. ---

--- may be the wordpress based application should come before the ssrn paper ---

--- may be write an application with python and tkinter and may be using the downloaded version
    of wordpress database. python application should do statistical analysis on the wordpress database.
    may be in future you may add a lot of other features to the application.
    you may add functional programming and other things. may be in  future generalize this application to
    work on any wordpress database. ---

--- may be you are a researcher . may be you can write papers about "penetrating through the layers
    of the stack and debugging"  with your beautifulwork.org experience. you may also write papers
    about "learning". ---
