--- may be focus on algorithms also. like 1. algorithm to download linux journal magazine 2. algorithm related to tiles
3. ... ---

--- may be you should learn a wide range of things so that you can penetrate through the layers of stack
    to do debug and fix things ---
    
--- may be to penetrate through the layers of the stack you have to learn about basics of relevent functions
    and concepts. ---


--- 1. BEAUTIFULWORK 2. DOLLECT 3. WORDPRESS PLUGIN BOPEN 4. APPLICATION USING PYTHON AND TKINTER(may be
       you can learn database and GUI programming along with this. 5. KERNEL HACKING (May be do error handling in C)
       and KUnit and selftests related. ---

WORK FLOW (NOV 20 2020)
-----------------------
Kernel Testing
looking for bugs in linux kernel.
BWORK  project
pypi.org -- python projects
lwn.net
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
writing  book about "filesystems" (about "knowledge building" with commands along with theory) (do not write this book)
writing  book about methods for general debugging. [book name may be "debug method hacks'
methods may be of different kind.
book will be like "hack,hack2,hack3... (it will be like  cookbook)
first write different hacks then organize(may be on web,system,appliction...) it to form chapters.
may be you can send hacks to other book projects
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


https://lwn.net/Articles/533552/

------------------------&lt;circle&gt;----------------------
[research]

input = linux kernel and debian package testing(both tests using build) (using dmesg for linux ).
output = learn how core system libraries(like libelf)  work
output = bug discovery
.

------------------------&lt;circle&gt;----------------------

---- basic system software installer (test and debug)
 --- basic commandline tools (system. Algorithm Test Debug)
---- application software (Algorithm Test Debug)
---- system software (Algorithm Test Debug)
 --- advanced system software (Algorithm Test Debug) -- todo
---  KERNEL address sanitizer -- todo

document the above 6 activities and form a study text book(book should mainly focus on testing)


may be write about software of aeound 600 lines without gui code
do kernel testing
learn system administration

update valavil theme to add a shell script to include step by step instructions to complete
the valavil theme installation
