1. debian bug filing and testing --- looking log of kernel using dmesg and also syslog and other logs in /var/log/
2. system adminitration -- Debian -- Desktop administration -- Server administration -- htop ( monitoring )
3. programming -- Dollect -- software written in python -- (bopen learn)  wordpress plugin in php  
4. knowledge building -- beautifulwork .
5. user interface -- hacking wordpress themes -- html css fonts -- styling fixes -- linux kernel


--- may be focus on algorithms also. like 1. algorithm to download linux journal magazine 2. algorithm related to tiles
3. ... ---

--- may be you should learn a wide range of things so that you can penetrate through the layers of stack
    to do debug and fix things ---
    
--- may be to penetrate through the layers of the stack you have to learn about basics of relevent functions
    and concepts. ---


--- 1. BEAUTIFULWORK 2. DOLLECT 3. WORDPRESS PLUGIN BOPEN 4. APPLICATION USING PYTHON AND TKINTER(may be
       you can learn database and GUI programming along with this. 5. KERNEL HACKING (May be do error handling in C)
       and KUnit and selftests related. ---
--- may be you should learn to read data from TXT as well as CSV files. ---


--- SHELL, PYTHON, SINGLE UNIX SPECIFICATION, OPENEND, DEBIAN, LINUX KERNEL

                           SHELL --O  TEST Linux Kernel ==> KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LINUX KERNEL AND SHELL [MEDIUM TERM]
			   BWORK --O  GENERAL UNIX LEARNING AND DISCOVERY  ==> KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GENERAL UNIX AND RESEARCH
			   https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/ ==> KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SINGLE UNIX SPECIFICATION
			   https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/bash/ ==> KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF GNU Bash 
			   DOLLECT --O  (used  python for development) ==> KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PROGRAMMING [SHORT TERM]
			   OPENEND --O TAKING EXPERIENCE FROM ALL OF THE ABOVE ==> KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LEARNING PROCESS ---

--- A CORE THING IS "METHODS TO FIND OPENENDS"


--- KNOWLEDGE BUILDING:

               1.   BWORK --O DEBIAN [ COME BACK ALGORITHM. APPLICATION FOR KNOWLEDGE BUILDING ] [LIFE LONG]

                    WORDPRESS
		    PHP
		    PYTHON
		    CSS
		    HTML
		    SQL
		    JAVASCRIPT
		    LINUX
		    
               2.   SINGLE UNIX SPECIFICATION [ LONG TERM ]
               3.   COURSES --O DATACAMP, COURSERA  --- [ SHORT TERM RELATED ]
                    

--- solve big problems in a simple way ---

--- CAREER TRACK = LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE BUILDING (BWORK)
    COURSES =  SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
    SKILL TRACK = SOFTWARE ALGORITHMS  ---

--- may be learning bring knowledge and learning again brings new knowledge and hence knowledge building ---

Kernel Testing
looking for bugs in linux kernel.
BWORK  project
pypi.org -- python projects
lwn.net
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
writing  book about "filesystems" (about "knowledge building" with commands along with theory)
writing  book about methods for general debugging. [book name may be "debug method hacks'
methods may be of different kind.
book will be like "hack,hack2,hack3... (it will be like  cookbook)
first write different hacks then organize(may be on web,system,appliction...) it to form chapters.
