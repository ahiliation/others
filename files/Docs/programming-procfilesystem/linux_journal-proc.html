One of the best investments in time that a person with a keen interest
in operating systems can make is to explore them from multiple
angles. Operating system installation and configuration can go a long way toward
solidifying the concepts that one reads about in system administration
and networking texts. Electronic references in the form of system manual 
(man) pages and the Linux info(1) facility are available for instant
consultation. 
<a href="http://groups.google.com">groups.google.com</a>, with its archive of 20-plus years of
Usenet postings, can provide expert guidance on issues ranging from DNS
configuration to memory interleaving. However, I feel another approach
is singularly unique when it comes to exploring operating systems--programming 
them.
</p><p>
My entry into systems programming was guided by my desire to understand
further the operating systems I was working with daily as a contract
UNIX and, later, Linux system administrator. The result of this was 
<a href="http://www.noorg.org/ifchk">ifchk</a>, a packet sniffer
detector I wrote in C and released in June of 2003. ifchk initially was 
written under IRIX and then ported to Linux, mostly under the 2.4 kernel.
The current ifchk revision, beta 4, recently was released and beta 5 is 
on the way.
</p><p>
My work on ifchk has allowed me to examine programmatically several areas
of operating system functionality. Examples include the Linux netlink(7)
and rtnetlink(7) facilities, device control--that is, network
interfaces--via ioctl(2), signals and proc, the process filesystem.
Proc and its ability to display a wide array of data concerning the
runtime state of a system are the focus of our discussion here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb44d28"></a>What Is /proc?</div><p>
Before we begin to talk about the proc filesystem as a programming
facility, we need need to establish what it actually is. The proc
filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem rooted at /proc that contains
user-accessible objects that pertain to the runtime state of the kernel
and, by extension, the executing processes that run on top of it.
"Pseudo" is used because the proc filesystem exists only as a reflection 
of the in-memory kernel data structures it displays. This is why most 
files and directories within /proc are 0 bytes in size.  
</p><p>
Broadly speaking, a directory listing of /proc reveals two main file groups.
Each numerically named directory within /proc corresponds to the process ID
(PID) of a process currently executing on the system. The following line of
<span class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> output illustrates this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">

dr-xr-xr-x    3 noorg    noorg           0 Apr 16 23:24 19636

</pre><p>
Directory 19636 corresponds to PID 19636, a current bash shell session.
These per-process directories contain both subdirectories and regular files
that further elaborate on the runtime attributes of a given process.
The proc(5) manual page discusses these process attributes at length.
</p><p>
The second file group within /proc is the non-numerically named directories
and regular files that describe some aspect of kernel operation. As an example,
the file /proc/version contains revision information relevant to the running
kernel image.
</p><p>
Proc files are either read-only or read-write. The /proc/version file above
is an example of a read-only file. Its contents are viewable by way of
cat(1), and they remain static while the system is powered up and accessible to users.
Read-write files, however, allow for both the display and modification of the
runtime state of the kernel. /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forwarding is one such file.
Using cat(1) on this file reveals if the system is forwarding IP datagrams
between network interfaces--the file contains a 1--or not--the file contains a 0.
In echo(1)ing 1 or 0 to this file, that is, writing to the file, we can enable
or disable the kernels ability to forward packets without having to build and
boot a new kernel image. This works for many other proc files with read-write
permissions.
</p><p>
Readers are invited to explore the /proc directory of an available system and
consult the proc(5) manual page to solidify their understanding of the
above discussion.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb45098"></a>Programming with /proc</div><p>
With the above foundation in place, we now turn our attention to using
the contents of /proc to examine programmatically an aspect of
the running kernel. A word of note: although the sample file ifmetric.txt 
discussed below contains all of the code we are referencing, additional
understanding can be gleaned by downloading and building ifchk and by
walking through its code, via gdb(1).  
</p><p>
One area of ifchk functionality deals with the display of counters
that describe transmitted and received packets across all network
interfaces attached to the system. ifchk does this by parsing and
processing /proc/net/dev.  Although the file contains all manner of
statistics concerning network interfaces, we are interested mainly in
the extraction of packet count data.  
</p><p>
ifMetric() is the function that implements all of the above
functionality. It can be found in the file, ifmetric.txt, that is
excerpted below. ifMetric() also can be found within the 
ifchk distribution in ~/ifchk-0.95b4/linux.c.  
</p><p>
The ifMetric() function is defined as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">

int ifMetric( struct ifList *list );

</pre><p>
*list is a pointer to the head of a linked list of structs of type ifList.
Each node describes characteristics of an interface present on the system.
ifList is defined in ~/ifchk-0.95b4/linux.h as such:
</p><pre class="programlisting">

struct ifList
{
    int flags;			/* Interface flags.                          */
    char data[DATASZ];		/* Interface name/unit number, e.g., "eth0". */
    struct ifList *next;	/* Pointer to next struct ifList.            */
 };

</pre><p>
In getting started, our first inclination might be to open the
/proc/net/dev file and begin searching for the relevant packet count
data. There is, however, some file reconnaissance work to be done in
between these two steps. Program failure due to maliciously crafted
input is a staple of security advisories these days. We cannot make
any assumptions about external program input, regardless of its source.
As we will see, there is another security-related reason why we
sequence the above file access operations as we do.  With all of the
above in mind, let's get to work.  
</p><pre class="programlisting">

540  int ifMetric( struct ifList *list )
541  {
542      struct stat fileAttrs;                 /* /proc/net/dev file

543      struct stat linkAttrs;                 /* /proc/net/dev link

544      char *filePath = NULL;                 /* Path to /proc/net/dev

545      FILE *file = NULL;                     /* File pointer for

546      int status = 0;                        /* /proc/net/dev file
close() status. */
547      char buf[1024] = "";                   /* Character buffer. */
548      struct ifList *cur = NULL;             /* Current node in
linked list. */
549      int conv = 0;                          /* sscanf() string match
count. */
550      long long rxPackets = 0;               /* Received packet

551      long long txPackets = 0;               /* Transmitted packet
count. */
552      char *delim = NULL;                    /* Ptr to matched
character in string. */
553      unsigned int ifIndex = 0;              /* Interface index. */
554      mode_t mode = 0;                       /* /proc/net/dev file
permissions. */

558      cur = list;

559      if( cur -&gt; data == NULL )
560      {
561          fprintf( stderr, "ifchk: ERROR: interface list is empty\n"
);
562          return (-1);
563       }

564      filePath = "/proc/net/dev";

565      if( ( lstat( filePath, &amp;linkAttrs ) ) != 0 )
566      {
567          perror( "lstat" );
568          return (-1);
569       }

570      if( S_ISLNK( linkAttrs.st_mode ) )
571      {
572          fprintf( stderr, "ifchk: ERROR: /proc/net/dev is a symbolic
link\n" );
573          return (-1);
574       }

</pre><p>
Before we open /proc/net/dev, we must be sure that the file is not actually a symbolic
link (symlink). If passed a symlink, which our proc file shouldn't be, fopen(3) would 
follow that link to what it points to. Our subsequent fstat(2) call, using the file
descriptor returned by fopen(3), would return data on the wrong file.
To protect against this, we lstat(2) /proc/net/dev and then check if it
is a symlink, by using the S_ISLNK POSIX macro. If S_ISLNK finds a
symlink, we print an error message with fprintf(3) and return -1, signifying failure. 
Otherwise, we continue on.
</p><pre class="programlisting">

578      if( ( file = fopen( "/proc/net/dev", "r" ) ) == NULL )
579      {
580          perror( "fopen" );
581          return (-1);
582       }

</pre><p>
Presuming that S_ISLNK didn't find a symlink, we next open the /proc/net/dev file by
calling fopen(3). If our call succeeds, fopen(3) returns a FILE pointer for use with
future operations on /proc/net/dev. If our call fails, we call perror(3) and return
-1, signifying failure. Notice that we check the return value of the fopen(3) call. 
Checking function return values is critical, to say the least.
</p><pre class="programlisting">

586      if( ( fstat( fileno( file ), &amp;fileAttrs ) ) != 0 )
587      {
588          perror( "fstat" );
589          return (-1);
590       }

</pre><p>
One of the first things I think about when writing code is how it might fail.
Additionally, I also think about how I can minimize the impact of failure by
failing gracefully through programming defensively. Doing this is crucial, I
feel, especially in light of the heightened state of concern regarding system
security and the potential impact of security compromises.
</p><p>
Given this, we must continue to probe /proc/net/dev, via fstat(2), to see if the
file exhibits what constitutes plausible attributes for a read-only proc file.
These attributes include its file type outside of being a symlink, size in bytes
and disk blocks, user and group ownership status and permissions. 
The following attribute criteria is based on what I have seen for /proc/net/dev on
the bulk of Linux systems I have worked on.
</p><pre class="programlisting">

file type:        regular
size in bytes:    0
size in blocks:   0
file ownership:   root:root
file permissions: 0444 (-r--r--r--)

</pre><p>
From the perspective of a default ifchk build, our /proc/net/dev file must
conform to the above attribute criteria. However, a simple modification
to the ifchk code, if required, can accommodate site policies and so on 
that differ from the above.  
</p><p>
If successful, fstat(2) fills in fileAttrs with /proc/net/dev attributes.
In the event of failure, we relay a descriptive error message to the
user via a call to perror(3). We then return -1, signifying failure.
Examining fileAttrs in gdb(1), we see that fstat(2) has the following
to say about /proc/net/dev (some struct members were removed from GDB 
output, as they did not add to the discussion): 
</p><pre class="programlisting">

(gdb) print fileAttrs 
$1 = {..., st_mode = 33060,
           st_uid = 0,
           st_gid = 0,
           st_size = 0,
           st_blocks = 0, ...}

</pre><p>
In the discussion above, I alluded to an additional security-related
reason behind the sequencing of our /proc/net/dev access procedures.
To recap, our handling of /proc/net/dev--outside of lstat(2) and our
not wanting to follow symlinks--currently consists of calling fopen(3)
followed by fstat(2). We just as easily could have achieved the same
result via a call to stat(2), not fstat(2), and then fopen(3), as
stat(2) returns the same file attribute data as fstat(2) does. So, why
use the former sequence--fopen(3), fstat(2)--instead of the latter one--stat(2), fopen(3)? 
Because we wish to avoid a race condition.  The stat(2), fopen(3)
sequence creates the possibility that the file
we referenced during the stat(2) call could have been substituted with
another one with possibly different attributes or even different contents 
once we got to the fopen(3) call. In this situation,
we'd think we were calling fopen(3) on the same file we just called
stat(2) on but, alas, not. The danger of this, I think, is obvious.

As an added measure in checking that we are working with the proc file we think we
are, we compare the inode numbers, st_ino, and resident filesystem,
st_dev, that both lstat(2) and fstat(2) reported in their /proc/net/dev attribute checks.
If all is well, the value of linkAttrs.st_ino should equal fileAttrs.st_ino and the
value of linkAttrs.st_dev should equal the the value of fileAttrs.st_dev. 
If we're okay here, we continue on. If not, we report an attribute consistency error via
fprintf(3) and return -1, signifying failure.

regular file\n" );
603          return (-1);
604       }

</pre><p>
S_ISREG is a POSIX macro that checks to see if its argument is a regular file and not,
say, a directory. If it is, we continue on. If not, we print an error message via
fprintf(3), and return -1, signifying failure. At this point, you might be asking why 
we need the lstat(2)/S_ISLNK symlink test above if we're testing for file type here. 
Referring back to the symlink test above should
help to answer that question.

Is /proc/net/dev 0 bytes in length and does it occupy 0 disk blocks? If we see zero
for both byte count and disk blocks, we continue on.
If not, we print an error message via fprintf(3) and return -1, signifying failure.
Notice that only one of the two file tests has to fail for the program to fail.

625      {
626          fprintf( stderr, "ifchk: ERROR: /proc/net/dev permissions
are not mode 0444\n" );
627          return (-1);
628       }

</pre><p>
Is /proc/net/dev mode 0444--read-only user, group and other?
ALLPERMS, defined in the /usr/include/sys/stat.h system header file, is a mask that
defines all file permissions, or mode 07777.
MODEMASK, defined within ~/ifchk-0.95b4/linux.h, is a mask that defines user, group
and other read permissions, or mode 0444.
</p><p>
By bitwise ANDing fileAttrs.st_mode with ALLPERMS and then comparing that result to
MODEMASK, we can see if /proc/net/dev is mode 0444. If it is, we continue execution.
If not, we print an error message via fprintf(3) and return -1, signifying failure.
This concludes our /proc/net/dev file attribute tests. However, before ifchk can work
with the file, we must examine its internal contents.
</p><p>
Testing the internal content structure or format of /proc/net/dev required that I
define a criteria under which ifchk would accept or reject the proc file.
As Linux has progressed, the number of fields--bytes, packets, errs--in
/proc/net/dev have changed. All of the /proc/net/dev files I have seen share an 
identical content structure to the file below; output to far right was truncated, 
due to space limitations:
</p><pre class="programlisting">

    lo:   34230     586    0    0    0     0          0         0    34230   ...

</pre><p>
Two lines of headers are followed by lines of per-interface statistics.
Older versions of the file do not contain the compressed field.  In the
name of simplicity, I decided that /proc/net/dev files that did not
contain this field would be rejected by ifchk.  With that foundation in
place, we now begin the process of examining /proc/net/dev internally.
</p><pre class="programlisting">

632      if( ! fgets(buf, sizeof( buf ), file) )
633      {
634          perror( "fgets" );
635          return (-1);
636       }

637      if( ! fgets(buf, sizeof( buf ), file) )
638      {
639          perror( "fgets" );
640          return (-1);
641       }

645      if( ( strstr( buf, "compressed" ) ) == NULL )
646      {
647          fprintf( stderr, "ifchk: ERROR: /proc/net/dev header format
is not supported\n" );
648          return (-1);
649       }

</pre><p>
We make two identical fgets(3) calls in a row to read the first and
second line of headers from /proc/net/dev. Each fgets(3) call results
in an overwrite of what previously was in buf. As a result, buf now
contains the second header line.  We then check to see if the second
line of headers contains the compressed field.  
</p><p>
If compressed is located in buf, our strstr(3) call succeeds and we
have what looks like a usable /proc/net/dev file.  If compressed
cannot be located in buf, we print an error message via fprintf(3)
and return -1, signifying failure.  With this, all of our testing,
which began by looking at file attributes, is done.  
</p><p>
The remainder of our counter output code takes the form of a while loop that handles
the processing and output of data for each interface. It iterates as 
many times as there are interfaces on the system.
</p><pre class="programlisting">

653      printf( "***   Network Interface Metrics   ***\n" );
654      printf( "Name    Index   RX-OK           TX-OK\n" );

659      while( fgets( buf, sizeof( buf ), file ) )
660      {
664          if( ( strstr( buf, cur -&gt; data ) ) != NULL )
665          {
666              delim = strchr( buf, ':' );

670              if( *( delim + 1 ) == ' ' )
671              {
672                  conv = sscanf( buf,
673                  "%*s %*Lu %Lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*Lu
%Lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu",
674                  &amp;rxPackets, &amp;txPackets );
675               }

676              else
677              {
678                  conv = sscanf( buf,
679                  "%*s %Lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*lu %*Lu %Lu

680                  &amp;rxPackets, &amp;txPackets );
681               }
682           }

</pre><p>
We call fgets(3) to read the next line of the /proc/net/dev file into buf. We then
call strstr(3) to check that the interface name in <tt>cur -&gt;
data</tt>, ifmetric.txt:558:, matches the interface name in the /proc/net/dev line we just read in.
Interface statistics lines in /proc/net/dev begin with an interface name, followed by
a colon followed by a count of bytes received on that interface. In some cases, there
is whitespace between the colon and the received bytes count, for
example, eth0: 6571407, and in other cases, not, eth0:12795779).
</p><p>
In order to maintain uniform column output in either of these cases, we use pointer
arithmetic to test for the existence of this white space. If whitespace does exist,
we enter the if() statement on line 670, whose sscanf(3) format specifiers deal with
it. If there is no whitespace, we enter the else block on line 676. These format
specifiers deal with the lack of whitespace.
</p><p>
In either case, the counters for both received and transmitted packets are copied by
sscanf(3) from /proc/net/dev to the variables rxPackets and txPackets for later
output.
</p><pre class="programlisting">

683          else

686
cur -&gt; data );
687              return (-1);
688           }

</pre><p>
If we compare the interface name in <tt>cur -&gt; data</tt>
to the name in /proc/net/dev and find a mismatch, we print an error
message via fprintf(3) and return -1, signifying failure.  
</p><pre class="programlisting">

692          if( conv != 2 )
693          {
694              fprintf( stderr, "ifchk: ERROR: /proc/net/dev parse
error\n" );
695              return (-1);
696           }

</pre><p>
If successful, our above sscanf(3) call returns the number of matched items. As a result,
the variable conv should equal 2 for rxPackets and txPackets. If not, we print an error
message via fprintf(3) and return -1, signifying failure.
</p><pre class="programlisting">

697          if( ( ifIndex = if_nametoindex( cur -&gt; data ) ) == 0 )

700              return (-1);
701           }

</pre><p>
Next, we call if_nametoindex(), passing it the interface name in
<tt>cur -&gt; data</tt> and, if successful, store the
integer interface index in ifIndex. If the call fails, we handle it as
usual. An interface index is a positive integer that the kernel assigns
to each interface present on the system.  
</p><pre class="programlisting">

702          printf( "%-7s %-7d %-13Lu   %-13Lu\n", cur -&gt; data,
ifIndex, rxPackets, txPackets );

705          if( cur -&gt; next != NULL )
706          {
707              cur = cur -&gt; next;
708           }
709       }

</pre><p>
Having built a line of counter output for the current interface, we print it. We then
return to the beginning of the while loop and continue or, having reached our loop
termination condition, exit the loop.
</p><pre class="programlisting">

713      if( ( status = fclose( file ) != 0 ) )
714      {
715          perror( "fclose" );

717       }

721      if( ( writeLog( LOGINFO, pw -&gt; pw_name, NULLSTATE ) ) != 0 )
722      {
723          fprintf( stderr, "ifchk: ERROR: could not pass logging
message to syslogd\n" );
724          return (-1);
725       }

726      return (0);
727  }

</pre><p>
Having exited the while loop, we call fclose(3), which corresponds to our fopen(3) call
on line 578. We then call our logging function to log that an interface counter dump
was performed.
</p><p>
With all processing done, ifchk produces the following packet count output on a system
with two interfaces:

    <p>I've just started to do more detailed programming with Linux and have also seen proc files processed with GHashTables.  This seems like it would work very with for stuff that lists off stuff in the "Desc: value" format.  Later you can just do lookups on the hash table.  I realize that that would be using a glib.h stuff, and is somewhat tied to gnome, but for now, lets not debate that part, and I'm working on gnome projects.  I just like to know if this is considered a valid way of processing the proc files.  Thanks.</p>

    <p>&gt; Damn, parsing proc files is just so much easier with Perl,</p>
<p>Originally, ifchk was a perl(1) wrapper around netstat(8) and ifconfig(8) (minus about 60% of it's current functionality).<br />
I decided to rewrite and extend the program in C for several reasons. One was runtime performance.</p>
<p>Also, if I had written the Linux proc routines in perl(1), that would have required a glue layer to bind the C code to it. I don't want this added overhead, runtime or otherwise.</p>
<p>Also, consider systems that, as a matter of policy, do not/must not have a perl(1) interpreter installed. A firewall is a good example of this.<br />
In my opinion, these systems should be loaded with the bare minimum to allow them to do their job. In this case, filtering packets, doing NAT, etc.<br />
What I'm getting at here is that the addition of programmatic tools, outside of a command interpreter, on such systems, is potentially dangerous. Such additions should be justified.</p>
<p>The proc routines that I provide in the article can be learnt by anyone willing to invest the time to do so. Additionally, an integral aim of the piece was to also provide some background on secure file access proceedures.</p>
<p>&gt; and can be used to produce real nice output.</p>
<p>netstat(8), with its sscanf(3) calls, is also capable of formatted output.</p>

<p>Thanks for the URL. I'll check it out.</p>
<p>&gt; it's also unclear to me why it matters if /proc/net/dev is a symlink... you're opening it read-only.</p>
<p>It has been my experience that /proc/net/dev has always been a zero byte file system object of type "file" (as opposed to a link/directory/fifo, etc).</p>
<p>The file access sequence I discuss in the article (lstat(2) -&gt; fopen(3) -&gt; fstat(2)) revolves around secure file access. What do I mean by that?<br />
Well, consider this scenario. We first call stat(2) on the file, checking that it's zero bytes in size, chowned root:root, etc. If it passes these attribute tests, the file conforms to our expectations of a legit procfs object. We then call fopen(3) on the file and access its contents. But... there's a problem here. What if the file we stat(2)ed is _not_ the same file we then call fopen(3) on? That is, what if the file was replaced with a different file between the 2 calls? What I'm describing here is a possible file based race condition.</p>
<p>My point is that you *cannot* assume anything when dealing with external input.<br />
In writing these routines, I was doing things like attempting file open operations on jpg images of Ferraris, MS Word docs, PDF files, gzipped tar archives, etc. I wanted to see how ifchk would deal with, what is, in the context of a legitimate /proc/net/dev file, garbage.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question.</p>

    <p>-   I think /proc is a great idea and somehow in line with UNIX overall philosophy (all is a "file").<br />

-    In that respect I think this article is a great idea, that is the reason I am here reading and commenting. Let's get out of "computer middle ages" of the 70es or 80es and recognize that after all an OS is just another application (I agree, a special one inn many respects, it has its own special objects to manipulate, has its own delicate "timing" conditions, it's sensitive HW interfaces etc....) but why so much "mistery" around it?</p>

    <p>&gt; I think /proc is a great idea and somehow in line with UNIX overall philosophy (all is a "file").</p>
<p>This is one of the things that really stood out for me when I started working with Linux. I can now access in-kernel structures as if they were a text file. cat(1), less(1), fopen(3), fstat(2) on a proc file. No problem.</p>
<p>&gt; I regret sometimes that the layout and the values of the/proc file system change from one OS version to the other, but maybe evolution requires that, so that's ok with me.</p>
<p>I comment on this, from within the context of sscanf(3), below.</p>

<p>This is where the Usenet archives shine. You can really piece alot together by sifting through the archives at groups.google.com. It's a _very_ powerful resource.</p>
<p>&gt; In that respect I think this article is a great idea,..</p>
<p>Thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed it. I certainly had alot of fun writing it.</p>
<p>&gt; ...but why so much "mistery" around it?</p>
<p>The more exploration one does, the more the mystery lessens. This is what I was getting at at the beginning of the article. Systems programming is like being able to view the internals of a running car engine, from all angles, in real time. That's enticing. And, like Usenet, powerful.</p>

    <p>The Windows Registry is NOTHING like /proc.  /proc gives you real time access to kernel parameters and the resources of running processes.  /proc exists entirely in memory.</p>
<p>The Windows Registry, on the other hand, is a database of configuration paramaters.  It's NOT real time, it does not contain info on running processes, and it does not give access to Windows kernel runtime parameters.</p>

    <p>&gt; The proc filesystem should be used as a programming facility.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>&gt; There are system calls for the same info.</p>
<p>Parsing proc files in /proc is a common way of accessing<br />
in-kernel structures (netstat(8) and ifconfig(8) do this).<br />
Sifting through the comp.os.linux.development.{system,apps}<br />
Usenet group archive illustrates this.</p>
<p>&gt; The format of the items in /proc can change from one kernel<br />
&gt; version to the next.</p>
<p>The programmer has to take care when dealing with conversion<br />
specification in sscanf(3) calls, etc. He/she has to understand<br />
the format of the proc object that is to be scanned.</p>
<p>&gt; Not all systems have /proc mounted.</p>
<p>That's ok. This is where function return value checks are so important. The lstat(2) call in the article code (line 565)<br />
returns error if it can't get to /proc/net/dev and we exit<br />
gracefully.</p>
<p>&gt; Also, not at flavours of Unix support /proc.</p>
<p>I wrote this piece from the perspective of the Linux system.</p>
<p>&gt; This article is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>

<p>You can't generalize that.  For instance, most firewall shell scripts use the /proc file system, which is perfectly legitimate.  The question is how far you want to push it, and the author is pushing it quite far.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this goes back to the "right tool for the right job" philosophy.  And the /proc filesystem definitely has its place in the toolbox.</p>
